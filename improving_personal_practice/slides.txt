# What We're Looking For
> "[C]ausal relationships are *ontological*, describing objective physical constraints in our world, whereas probabilistic relationships are *epistemic*, reflecting what we know or believe about the world."

.right[\- Judea Pearl, *Causality: Models, Reasoning and Inference* (2nd, 2009)]

???
- **Functions which describe stable patterns**
    - *Causative* patterns are implicit in this definition
- We acknowledge certain statistical patterns as indicative of causality
- These are almost exclusively *time-varying, "forward", ordered sets*

Since we are assessing for patterns indicative of causality, a reasonably rigorous definition should be employed...

---

# Working Definition
> High performance implies a statistical reliability that within information space ($S$) future performance ($P$) will closely resemble ideal performance ($I$) such that for $I,P \in S$ 

$$\mu_{I-P} = \mu_I - \mu_P \approx 0.0$$

$$\sigma_{I-P}^2 = \sigma_I^2 - \sigma_P^2 \approx 0.0$$

???
- Distributions may be thought of as selection functions which define information spaces
- The specificity of these function definitions make them difficult to informatively apply to other information spaces
- Performance is domain-bound for the same reason (high specificity)
	- E.g. domains of expertise do not transfer

There are many possible information spaces, we'll quickly review an example...

    </tr>
</table>

???
- Task model on right, task results on left
	- Note the complexity of interactions in the causal model (this is a simple one...)
- Provider A's performance unambiguously superior (variance is dangerous) because their behavior
	- Resulted in a larger number of "consonant" interactions
	- Mitigated the influence of $U$ (uncertainty) set
- Interactions are patterning

Interactions occur at many "resolutions"...

# Work Context <span style="font-size: 0.45em;">(Espinosa et al, 2007)</span>
<img src="img/Espinosa_fig2_p624.png" width="63.5%" height="63.5%" />

- "Best in class" (in my opinion) of a number of studies summarizing the topic

| loc | ref | x | y | ⧫ | ◼ | Summary |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| `UL` | a | Task Familiarity | Structural Complexity | ++Low | High | *TASK familiarity is most beneficial when structural complexity is low* |
| `UR` | b | Team Familiarity | Geographic Dispersion | Colocated | ++Distributed | *Familiarity is most beneficial for distributed teams* |
| `LL` | c | Team Familiarity | Team Size | Low | ++High | *Larger teams benefit most from familiarity* |
| `LR` | d | Team Familiarity | Task Familiarity | ++Low | High | *TEAM familiarity is a greater benefit when TAsk familiarity is low* |

- The composition of $S$ varies across these contexts, $\therefore I$
- Literature suggests enlargement of interactive environment introduces communication difficulties
- *Think of work environment as the context of habit.*

Sensible or otherwise, humans have a burning desire to adapt to their local environment. Interaction, *of any kind* (avoidance, fear, frustration, ...), patterns our behavior, and may do so deeply...

---

# Neurophysiology
- Brain physically adapts to *stimuli*
- Specialization lowers (metabolic) demand of (stimuli) processing
- Automation trends toward the *mode* (of stimuli)

$$f: \text{SocialMedia → Garbage}$$

???
- Neurologic adaptation to stimuli, with the goal of automation, is a foregone conclusion
- General circuitry is inefficient
- *Patterning is achieved indiscriminantly **by** our behavior **at** the "speed of stress"*
- $f$
    - "Divided attention training..."
	    - We more often need the ability to cultivate vertically in our jobs
    - Thanks to Jesse Corry (Board Certified Stroke Neurologist)

We may change them, but the brain won't yield inconvenient patterns (e.g. inattentive, reactive, anxious, ...) as we desire. It plays a long-term strategy...

---

# Automation
- You may consider automation a "category view" of adaptive neurophysiologic specialization
- Fairly a "deep learning" process

$$f: \text{effort} \gt \text{minimum viable} \to \text{effort} \lor \text{minimum viable}$$

???
- Habit is an expression of automation, as are fight/flight, anxiety, feelings toward others, ...
- $\text{general} \to \text{specific}$ along "gradient of effort"
- Automation behaviors are strongly correlated with performance in a given information space ($P \in S_i$)—this can be desireable or not, according to $f$.

We need multiple draws from a partially-known distribution to characterize it, this most often negatively affects performance...

# Self Regulation
<img src="img/Zimmerman-person_behavior_environment.svg" width="92.5%" height="92.5%" />
.right[<span style="font-size: 0.66em;">Barry J. Zimmerman. *A social cognitive view of self-regulated academic learning.* (1989). From Zimmerman *Development and Adaptation of Expertise*$\ldots$ (p707, 2006)</span>]

???
- Domains of expertise $\neq$ transfer, but performance drop is normal and expected for the unfamiliar

This is frequently difficult to receive, and since we may self-regulate into a large number of behaviors it is **easy to automate a return to the familiar** (e.g. avoidance). Social ability is a huge help here...

---

# Single Consensus Finding
Social Ability $S$ $\ggg$ General Mental Ability $G$, where $\hat{a}$ represents the effect size of $G$ and $\lambda$ is total effect

$$\lambda = \hat{a} \cdot G \circ S$$

$$\hat{a}(S) = \begin{cases}
\gt 0, & \text{when} \uparrow S \\\
\le 0, & \text{when} \downarrow S
\end{cases}$$

???
- Socialization is a source of stimuli, and a non-negotiable need for human development
- Social contexts are fertile ground for negative interpersonal feedback loops, which social ability mitigates these
- Social engagement has a strong correlation to many types of "success" (e.g. academic, personal, professional, ...)
- Baltes and Diehl (2018), Sonnentag *et al* (2006), and Verbeke (2008) provide apt summaries

Social connection, underwritten by social ability, reduces the fear of *consequence* of failure—encouraging exploration and resilience. Consider that, in software, **we navigate social contexts to deliver technical solutions** and judge merit by **external efficacy.**

# Improving Personal Practice
> "[P]erformance is not a variable that is part of the system that can be directly influenced as with other parts of the system. It emerges when the variables work or interact together in an appropriate way, which entails that it must be reproduced continuously. [...] One cannot intervene into performance. One can intervene into the system, whose parts by working together, make performance emerge."

.right[\- Klaus D. Wittkuhn, *Understanding Performance Improvement* (2016)]

???
- Interaction with "the system" is responsible for automation

--

### Key Points
- Performance patterns are "sticky"
- Self perception of self efficacy is a liability
- $\text{improvement} \perp t \text{ when } t \ge t_{min}$

???
#### Key Points
- Automation sees to "stickiness"
	- See Singh *et al*, model presented is compelling
- Self perception has a deterministic influence on behavior, $\therefore$ automation
- Chronological models are *wrong*, so associated models are precluded
- High performers use *dynamic* behavioral strategies to interact passively benefit from an *evolving* environment.

# Generic Process <span style="font-size: 0.45em;">(Wittkuhn, 2016)</span>
- Define the performance in question
- Identify the variables that influence the performance
- Model the performance system in order to understand how these variables interrelate
- Identify gaps and opportunities in the performance system
- Identify possible interventions to close these gaps
- Look for economic interventions that have leverage and influence other variables beyond the targeted variable and yield a diffusion of effect
- Observe what is happening when you implement the intervention and take corrective action as needed

???
- Most common request during pilot testing was for $n$ step method
- This is the most authentically accurate I could find
- And a clear example of why performance is domain bound

For purposes of modeling, I split the list into three sections...

Let's build a few models using seeds from Sonnentag (2006) and Baltes and Diehl (2018). These are not finely wrought and show one of many valid representations. We move forward with the understanding that PPC<sub>$n$</sub> $\to G_{n+1}$

- Goal from Sonnentag et al (2006), variables from Baltes and Diehl (2018)

This model is essentially passive. It does not allow us much longitudinal influence, nor is it optimized...

- Using a well-structured curriculum helps, but...
- This model is naive, poorly reflective of curricular structure
- A successful learning endeavour will address such naivety

In essence, our goal *for the task* is to refactor the graph into one fairly representative of curriculum's structure...

- $\Lambda$: I'm going to combine a "learning for mastery" strategy—repeat task till proficient—with a few simple outcome goals
- Thus my intervention $(do(\cdot))$ is "global" and I will align goal completion with a more generic understanding of the functions under study
- Tony Morris may disagree, but that's an excellent opportunity for refinement

The essential improvement is reduction in number of incoming arrows to $G_2$. This dramatically increases the chance repeating these exercises will meaningfully refine our graph...

### Posterior Predictive Checks
- Both PPC items should stabilize near minimum values
- This **DOES NOT** indicate mastery of task, only that the learning effect is expended for now

**Potential Improvements**
- `lift2` has strongest representation, treat specially?
- Where should $V_0$ go?

Ideally, we would have a related, less structured, project to work on shortly following "convergence", which I now want you to hear as **automation**. A more ambiguous task will challenge automation and increase our chance of genuine improvement...

That's the end of my examples. Let's summarize...

---

# Summary

--

### High Performers

--

- Are characterized by statistical regularity of *outcome* in a particular environment
- Model their practice as one of social efficacy *reinforced* by knowledge and technical ability

--

### High Performance

--

- Is bound to a domain because it is well-attenuated to the needs of that environment
- Is "sticky"
- May be automated, and social reinforcement is especially helpful

---

# Summary

### Personal Practice

--

- Is the result of automation behaviors
- Is modifiable of our own effort

--

### Performance Improvement

--

- Is the side effect of a dynamic process
