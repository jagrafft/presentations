    1. Objectives
    2. Context
        - These data will demand we acknoledge and interface with an awkwardly dimensional set of "external" domains--that we are not masters of.
        - Dataset is large enough and has sufficient integrity for aleatory association.
        - Skilled professionals in the domain of public (or public-facing) EC-12 education have a keen sense of *limits*, and for when it is appropriate to undesrtand one item via another.
        - EC-12 edudcation systems and their component systems (States, Districts, Schools, Classrooms, ...) are highly individual and evaluating them accurately without direct experiece is nearly impossible.
            - Medicine is less complex.
    3. Contract
        - Let's bias our discussion to the technical side today. This keeps the playing field open but raises the entry bar to help us focus on our objectives.

    1. Smarter Balanced Assessment
        - Created by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, which originally had ~30 members
        - For 2017 California "flat" (+~0.10%), remaining thirteen (13) states negative gains.
            - Hugely abnormal
            - Significant source of epistemic uncertainty
            - SB Consortium says "It's fine."
    2. Context
        - Scale and overlapping authority heavy confounders
        - Domains of expertise do not transfer
    3. Large-Scale Test Construction
        - Speaking in general terms here
3. **The Data**
    1. Set
4. **Preparation**
    1. Execution Environment
        - "Average" hardware
        - Docker imposes significant resource constraint
