1. **Objectives**
2. **Context**
    - These data will demand we acknoledge and interface with an awkwardly dimensional set of "external" domains--that we are not masters of.
    - Dataset is large enough and has sufficient integrity for aleatory association.
    - Skilled professionals in the domain of public (or public-facing) EC-12 education have a keen sense of *limits*, and for when it is appropriate to undesrtand one item via another.
    - EC-12 edudcation systems and their component systems (States, Districts, Schools, Classrooms, ...) are highly individual and evaluating them accurately without direct experiece is nearly impossible.
        - Medicine is less complex.
3. **Contract**
    - Let's bias our discussion toward the technical today. This keeps the playing field open but raises the entry bar to help us focus on the objectives.
4. **Smarter Balanced Assessment**
    1. &nbsp;
        - Created by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, which originally had ~30 members
        - For 2017 California "flat" (+~0.10%), remaining thirteen (13) states negative gains.
            - Hugely abnormal
            - Significant source of epistemic uncertainty
            - Consortium may have modified test between 2016 and 2017
            - Consortium says: "Results aren't the test."
    2. Context of Results
        - Scale and overlapping authority heavy confounders
        - Domains of expertise do not transfer
        - Pass, near pass, no pass
    3. Large-Scale Test Construction
        - Speaking in general terms here
5. **The Data**
    1. Sources
        - Multiple years' worth aggregated into a set
    2. Set
    3. Integrity Issues
        - "Precision" limited to *ones* place
        - "Independence relationship" requires handling
            - Source of confounding
            - State of California warns about this on data download page
        - 2017 results \&\& SB response
            - Foundational epistemic uncertainty critically degrages inductive model results
            - Aleatory uncertainty also affected, but structural defects are less of a problem for associative assertions
6. **Data Preparation**
    1. Execution Environment
        - "Average" hardware
        - Docker imposes significant resource constraint
            - ~3.87GB (Pull up Activity Monitor?)
    2. &nbsp;
        - Look at `data_preparation.md`
7. **Applying Julia Functions**
    - Largely code
